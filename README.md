# desert-relief-salve-interest-preview
Add a second page that’s framed as a Preview / Coming Soon — no heavy sales language, just a way to reserve interest.  Still shows benefits, LaLa story, colors/fonts.  Instead of “buy now” or “order,” it says “Reserve your jar when we go live”.  The form just captures name, email, what size or how many jars they might want.
